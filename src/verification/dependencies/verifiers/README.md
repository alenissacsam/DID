Groth16 Verifiers (Generated)

This folder can hold Solidity verifiers generated by snarkjs for specific circuits.

Important:
- snarkjs emits a contract named `Groth16Verifier` in each file.
- If you place multiple such files here, Foundry will see duplicate contract names and fail compilation.

Best practice:
- Deploy verifiers directly from `tools/zk-circuits/build/*.sol` without copying into `src`:
  - forge create --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY tools/zk-circuits/build/AgeVerifier.sol:Groth16Verifier
- Record the deployed address and register it in `ZKProofManager` via `addProofType`.

If you must copy into src for audit/reference, ensure only one verifier file with `Groth16Verifier` exists at a time, or manually rename the contract class consistently across the file and usages (advanced).
